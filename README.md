# Multiclipboard
> Keep track of multiple pieces of text.

## General info
The program will save each piece of clipboard text under a keyword. For example, when you run py mcb.pyw save spam, the
current contents of the clipboard will be saved with the keyword spam. 
This text can later be loaded to the clipboard again by running py mcb.pyw spam. 
And if the user forgets what keywords they have, they can run py mcb.pyw list to copy a list of all keywords to the clipboard.
